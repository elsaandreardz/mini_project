# Review Report, by Bálint Décsi

## Reproducibility
* This repository follows the guidelines of reproducibility. I had no problem whatsoever understanding the folder structure and running the code.
* I only had to change the input filepath from `utmb_2017.csv` to `../data/utmb_2017.csv`. I'm aware though that relative paths can work differently on different systems and this problem is kind of inevitable.

## Clean Documentation
* The code has the respective README, which is clear and concise. Image and link insertion and toher formatting is used correctly.
* However, I suggest improving the requirements and results sections, as they seemed incomplete to me.

## Analysis, coding style and git
* The code itself works excellently and its features totally make sense. I find the dataset source and usage of kaggle creative. It is evident Andrea understands git and used it in the intended way.
* I would put the different snippets into different cells and would not put the environment name into the environment file name. A good practice is to name it just `environment.yml`.

Nice job! :)
